In Terraform, provisioners are a feature used to execute scripts or commands on local or remote resources during resource creation or after it's created. They are often used for tasks such as initializing a new resource, installing software, configuring services, or running custom scripts.

There are two types of provisioners in Terraform:

    Local-exec provisioner: This provisioner runs scripts or commands on the machine where Terraform is being executed. It's useful for tasks that don't require remote access to the target resource.

    Remote-exec provisioner: This provisioner connects to the target resource via SSH (for Linux-based systems) or WinRM (for Windows-based systems) and executes scripts or commands on the remote machine. It's suitable for tasks that require interaction with the target resource.
